echo "- Compares current period vs previous period call volumes"
echo "- Calculates percentage reduction in call volume"
echo "- Estimates cost impact based on $15 per call (industry average)"
echo "- Color-coded thresholds: Red (<5%), Yellow (5-15%), Green (>15%) reduction"
echo "- Responsive to dashboard time range and channel filters"
