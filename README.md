# App Engagement Intelligence - Your Users' New Best Friend! 🤖✨

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to our smart system that helps your app users have amazing experiences while keeping their data safe and sound. Think of it as having a really thoughtful assistant who notices when users might need help and provides just the right nudge at the perfect moment.

## 🎯 What This Thing Actually Does

Picture this: You've got users navigating your IKK classic insurance app, and sometimes they get stuck, confused, or frustrated. Our system is like having a super-smart friend watching over their shoulder (with their permission, of course!) who notices patterns and says "Hey, looks like you might need some help here!"

We watch how people use your app, learn what works and what doesn't, and then send helpful messages through whatever channel they prefer - maybe a gentle push notification, a friendly email, or a quick SMS. The best part? We do all this while being absolutely obsessive about privacy and following all those important GDPR and GDNG rules.

### What Makes This Special? ✨

- **🔍 Real-time Detective Work**: We watch how people use your app and spot patterns faster than you can say "user journey"
- **🧠 AI-Powered Helper**: Our smart algorithms figure out exactly what help each person needs and when they need it
- **📱 Multi-Channel Magic**: Whether someone prefers push notifications, emails, SMS, or in-app messages - we've got it covered
- **🔒 Privacy Champion**: We're absolutely obsessed with keeping user data safe and following all the rules (GDPR and GDNG certified!)
- **👥 Age-Smart Personalization**: Different generations use apps differently, so we tailor everything accordingly
- **🧪 Test Everything**: Our A/B testing framework helps you figure out what actually works (no more guessing!)
- **📊 Crystal Clear Analytics**: Beautiful dashboards that actually make sense and show you the ROI

## 🏗️ How We Built This Thing

Think of our system like a well-organized restaurant kitchen - everyone has their job, and they all work together seamlessly:

- **🍽️ The Host (Event Collection Service)**: Greets every user interaction and makes sure everything's in order
- **👨‍🍳 The Chef (Analytics Service)**: Takes all those interactions and turns them into delicious insights
- **🎯 The Waiter (Engagement Service)**: Delivers exactly what each customer needs, when they need it
- **🛡️ The Manager (Compliance Service)**: Makes sure we're following all the rules and keeping everyone safe
- **📮 The Delivery Driver (Notification Service)**: Gets your messages to users however they prefer to receive them

## 🚀 Let's Get You Up and Running!

Ready to see this magic in action? Great! Let's get everything set up. Don't worry - we'll walk through this step by step.

### What You'll Need First

Before we dive in, make sure you have these tools ready:

- Node.js 18+ and npm (the newer, the better!)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for easy setup)
- PostgreSQL 15+ (our database of choice)
- Redis 7+ (for super-fast caching)

### Your Development Setup Journey

**Step 1: Get the code**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ikk-classic/app-engagement-intelligence.git
   cd app-engagement-intelligence
   ```

**Step 2: Install all the goodies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**Step 3: Set up your secrets**
   ```bash
   cp environments/.env.development .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration - don't worry, we've included helpful comments!
   ```

**Step 4: Wake up the database and cache**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres redis
   ```

**Step 5: Get the database ready**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

**Step 6: Fire it up!**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

🎉 **Ta-da!** Your system is now running at:

- **API**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (this is where the magic happens)
- **Health Check**: [http://localhost:3000/health](http://localhost:3000/health) (to make sure everything's happy)
- **Metrics**: [http://localhost:9090/metrics](http://localhost:9090/metrics) (for the data nerds)

### Want the Full Experience?

If you want to see everything working together (including our beautiful dashboards), just run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This gives you the complete package:

- **App Engagement Intelligence API** (port 3000) - The brain of the operation
- **PostgreSQL database** (port 5432) - Where we store everything safely
- **Redis cache** (port 6379) - For lightning-fast responses
- **Prometheus monitoring** (port 9091) - Keeps an eye on performance
- **Grafana dashboard** (port 3001) - Pretty charts and graphs!

## 📊 Let's See It in Action!

Ready to play around? Here are some examples to get you started. Think of these as your first "hello world" moments with our system.

### Telling Us What Users Are Doing

Here's how you send us information about what's happening in your app:

```typescript
import { EngagementIntelligenceClient } from './src';

const client = new EngagementIntelligenceClient({
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key' // Keep this secret!
});

// Let's say someone just viewed their dashboard
await client.events.submit({
  eventId: 'evt_123456', // Unique ID for this event
  userId: 'user_789', // Who did this?
  sessionId: 'session_abc', // Their current session
  eventType: 'page_view', // What happened?
  metadata: {
    screenName: 'dashboard',
    duration: 30000 // They spent 30 seconds there
  },
  userContext: {
    ageGroup: '31-40', // Helps us personalize better
    digitalLiteracyScore: 7 // Scale of 1-10
  }
});
```

### Getting Your Analytics Fix

Want to see how things are going? Here's how to get your dashboard data:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/analytics/dashboard?timeRange=24h" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Handling User Privacy Like a Pro

Because privacy matters, here's how you manage what users are comfortable with:

```typescript
// User says "yes, you can analyze my usage"
await client.compliance.grantConsent('user_123', 'analytics', true);

// Check what they've agreed to
const consent = await client.compliance.getConsent('user_123');
console.log('User is okay with:', consent);
```

## 🧪 Making Sure Everything Actually Works

We're pretty obsessive about quality, so here's how to run all our tests and make sure nothing's broken:

### Running the Test Suite

```bash
# The basic tests (quick and essential)
npm test

# Integration tests (making sure services play nice together)
npm run test:integration

# End-to-end tests (testing real user scenarios)
npm run test:e2e

# Coverage report (see how much code is actually tested)
npm run test:coverage
```

### What We Test (Because We're Thorough)

- **🔬 Unit Tests**: Each little piece works on its own
- **🔗 Integration Tests**: All the pieces work together nicely
- **🎭 End-to-End Tests**: Real user journeys from start to finish
- **⚡ Performance Tests**: Making sure we can handle the load
- **🛡️ Compliance Tests**: Double-checking we follow all the privacy rules

## 🚢 Ready to Go Live?

When you're ready to deploy this to the real world, we've got you covered with multiple environments and easy deployment scripts.

### Where Can You Deploy This?

We support three different setups:

- **🏠 Development**: Your local machine with Docker Compose (perfect for testing)
- **🎪 Staging**: Kubernetes cluster for testing with real-ish data
- **🏭 Production**: Multi-zone Kubernetes deployment (the real deal!)

### Super Easy Deployment

We've made deployment as simple as a single command:

```bash
# Deploy to your development environment
./scripts/deploy.sh development

# Deploy to staging with a specific version
./scripts/deploy.sh staging --version v1.2.3

# Deploy to production (handle with care!)
./scripts/deploy.sh production --version v1.0.0 --registry my-registry.com
```

### The Secret Sauce (Environment Variables)

For production, you'll need these important secrets. Keep them safe!

```bash
# Database connection
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_PASSWORD=secure-password

# Security stuff (make these really random!)
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-char-encryption-key
HASH_SALT=your-hash-salt

# External services (get these from your providers)
PUSH_NOTIFICATION_API_KEY=your-fcm-key
EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-key
SMS_SERVICE_API_KEY=your-twilio-key
```

## 📈 Keeping an Eye on Things

We believe in transparency and keeping track of how everything's performing. Here's how we monitor the system:

### Health Checks (Is Everything Okay?)

- **🏥 Application Health**: Just visit `/health` to see if we're alive and kicking
- **🗄️ Database Health**: We check if our database is responsive and performing well
- **🌐 External Services**: Making sure all our third-party integrations are working
- **🛡️ Compliance Status**: Continuous monitoring to ensure we're following all privacy rules

### Performance Metrics (For the Data Lovers)

We expose detailed metrics at `/metrics` that you can hook up to your monitoring systems:

- How fast we respond to requests (spoiler: very fast!)
- User engagement trends and patterns
- Success rates for our helpful interventions
- Any compliance hiccups (hopefully zero!)
- System resource usage (keeping things lean)

### Pretty Dashboards

We've set up beautiful Grafana dashboards that actually make sense:

- **🖥️ System Performance**: How fast and efficient everything is running
- **👥 User Engagement**: What people are doing and how engaged they are
- **🎯 Intervention Success**: Which of our helpful nudges are working best
- **📋 Compliance Reports**: Making sure we're always following the rules

## 🔒 Privacy & Security - We Take This Seriously

This isn't just a checkbox for us - privacy and security are built into everything we do.

### Privacy by Design (Our Philosophy)

- **🎯 Data Minimization**: We only collect what we absolutely need, nothing more
- **📝 Purpose Limitation**: We use your data only for what we said we'd use it for
- **✋ Consent Management**: Granular control - users decide exactly what they're comfortable with
- **🎭 Data Anonymization**: We use clever pseudonymization so nobody can track back to individuals
- **🗑️ Right to be Forgotten**: Automated data deletion when users want their data gone

### Security Features (The Technical Stuff)

- **🔐 Strong Authentication**: JWT-based tokens that are secure and reliable
- **👮‍♀️ Access Control**: Role-based permissions - everyone gets exactly the access they need
- **🔒 Encryption Everything**: Your data is encrypted whether it's stored or traveling around
- **🚫 Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DDoS attacks
- **📊 Audit Everything**: We keep detailed logs of who did what and when

### Compliance (Following All the Rules)

- **🇪🇺 GDPR Compliant**: Full compliance with EU data protection laws
- **🇩🇪 GDNG Compliant**: German health data protection? We've got it covered
- **📋 Audit Trails**: Immutable logs that regulators love to see
- **⏰ Data Retention**: Automated lifecycle management - data doesn't stick around longer than it should

## 📚 API Documentation - Your New Best Friend

Want to dive deep into the technical details? We've written comprehensive API docs that are actually readable! Check out our [API Guide](docs/API.md) - we promise it's friendlier than most technical docs.

### The Essential Endpoints

Here are the main things you can do with our API:

- **📝 `POST /events`** - Tell us about user interactions (this is where the magic starts!)
- **📊 `GET /analytics/dashboard`** - Get beautiful engagement analytics
- **🎯 `POST /interventions`** - Create and send helpful interventions
- **✋ `POST /compliance/consent`** - Manage user privacy preferences
- **💚 `GET /health`** - Check if everything's running smoothly

### Getting Access

All endpoints need a JWT token (except the health check - that's open to everyone):

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/endpoint
```
