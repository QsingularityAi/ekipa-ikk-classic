# App Engagement Intelligence - System Architecture

## Overview

The App Engagement Intelligence system is designed as a microservices-based platform that analyzes user behavior, generates personalized interventions, and ensures GDPR/GDNG compliance. The system processes user interaction events in real-time and delivers targeted interventions across multiple channels to improve digital adoption.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Privacy by Design**: All data processing adheres to GDPR and GDNG requirements
2. **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable microservices architecture
3. **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation
4. **Real-time Processing**: Event-driven architecture for immediate response
5. **Compliance First**: Built-in audit trails and consent management
