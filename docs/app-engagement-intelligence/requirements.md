# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The IKK classic insurance app currently has low user engagement, with only around 10% of insured individuals actively using the available digital services. Users continue to rely on phone calls, face-to-face consultations, and paper-based workflows instead of leveraging the app's existing features. This feature aims to create an intelligent system that analyzes user behavior, identifies engagement barriers, and implements targeted interventions to increase digital adoption while reducing manual processes for both customers and staff.
