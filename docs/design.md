# Design Document - The Story Behind Our Decisions

## What We Built and Why

Picture this: You've got a fantastic mobile app, but you're not quite sure how people are using it. Are they getting stuck somewhere? Do they love certain features? Are there opportunities to help them succeed? That's exactly the problem we set out to solve!

Our App Engagement Intelligence system is like having a really smart, privacy-conscious friend watching over your app users. It notices patterns, spots opportunities to help, and delivers just the right message at just the right time. Think of it as three core pieces working together:

1. **The Observer** - Watches what users do (with their permission!) and learns from their behavior
2. **The Thinker** - Uses AI to understand patterns and figure out how to help users succeed  
3. **The Helper** - Makes sure everything follows privacy rules while keeping detailed records

The whole system is built with one key principle: help users have a better experience while respecting their privacy and following all the rules (especially German health data regulations).

We process user interactions as they happen, run them through smart algorithms to identify when someone might need help, and then send perfectly timed messages through their preferred channel - whether that's a gentle in-app nudge, a push notification, SMS, or email. Every step is designed to reduce support calls, save time, and make users happier.

## How Everything Connects

Here's a bird's-eye view of how our system works - imagine it like a well-designed factory where each station has a specific job:

```

### Data Flow Architecture

The system follows a privacy-by-design approach with data minimization and purpose limitation:

1. **Event Collection**: Client-side SDK captures user interactions with explicit consent
2. **Stream Processing**: Real-time event processing with immediate anonymization where possible
3. **Behavioral Analysis**: Pattern recognition and user segmentation based on engagement metrics
4. **Intervention Generation**: AI-powered recommendation engine creates personalized engagement strategies
5. **Delivery & Measurement**: Multi-channel delivery with real-time effectiveness tracking

## Components and Interfaces
